        I am intrested and exctied to learn react this semester. I think this will be good to help bring my webdev skills to the next level
        I also hope to learn more about hosting websites. Along the sames lines, I want to learn about domains and how to get a custom domain.
        Overall, I hope to get better at C# and really understand it as a programing language.
